Black Ops 1 Zombies Glitches Unpatched Back To Day 1 Versions of each map by Ultimateman.
Still reminiscing the old days? 

Remember how Malcolm did that epic knife lunge or how Johnny escaped to outskirts of Asccension by doing the Lunar Lander glitch?
Relive the old days now with my new release, Project Old Days.
The original release of this mod was back in 2020, but I'm now putting it up here on github.

This mod removes pretty much all of the glitch fixes for all of bo1's zombie maps.
If you don't remember all of the glitches, you can watch my bo1 unpatched video compilations on youtube by searching up ; ultimateman bo1 unpatched.

This mod was built with linker_mod.

Works on:
Steam version
game_mod version

Not tested:
Plutonium version

- Players spawn in with ballistic knives ( secondary )
- Lunar Lander glitch difficulty decreased by removing the whole collision barrier around lander's gates while in air ( have fun 8) )
- Throwing a semtex at George freezes him so that you can focus on glitches
- Moon vision files tweaked heavily to be more pleasing on eyes
- Most maps minor .vision file visual over hauls
- Minor improvements might be updated here
- Please star this project if you enjoy it!
- Tutorial file included in the download pack!
